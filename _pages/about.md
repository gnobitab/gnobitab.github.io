刘星超<br>**Ph.D. Student<br>[Computer Science Department](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/)<br>[University of Texas at Austin](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/)**<br> *E-mail: xcliu (at) utexas (dot) edu*


I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. student, advised by [Prof. Qiang Liu](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~lqiang/). Prior to that, I graduated from Beihang University with a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering. In 2018, I worked with [Prof. Hao Su](http://ai.ucsd.edu/~haosu/) at UC San Diego.

My research interests include, but not limited to, probablistic inference, generative modeling and their real-world applications.
